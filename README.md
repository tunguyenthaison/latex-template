# Templates

This repo contains templates for multiple latex-types project. The purpose is to
create a minimal working template that work well for (maybe not all):
- local lightweight tex engine.
- overleaf (should not be a problem).
- most importantly, an `html` rendering system, could be `lwarp` or 
    the `python` package `plastex`. 

The repo also contains custom `CSS` template to render prettier out-of-the-box results from `plastex`. 

- [notes](/notes/): templates for all latex notes.
- [notes-plastex](/notes-plastex/): templates that work with `plastex` out of the box.
